### Conclusion
Tests are an important part of every programming process. Personally I has certainly understood that for myself. It is quite a useful tool, because you can immediatly understand does your app work correctly or not and therefore prevent some unexpected issues. However, in order to write them you need to think really carefully and profoundly, and this works only if you are skilled enough.
Personally I found this assignment extremely useful. Unittesting helped me a lot in debugging process of the app.
